classdef Contact_1      % define a class named by Contact (with Uppercase letter)
    properties          % define properties of the class 
        FirstName       % Each peroperties with Capital letters
        LastName
        PhoneNumber
    end
end

% Now we can type a variable (like person) and then assign the class (Contact) to the variable.
% We type in command window: person = Contact_1
% Now we must assign value to the person like struct...so person is like struct and each of peroperties are fields.
% So, we can write: 
% person.FirstName = "Ali"
% person.LastName = "Ahmadi"
% person.PhoneNumber = "021345654354"
